      bio: "Hayley Denbraver is a web developer in San Diego, California.
      She is a career switcher who used to work as a licensed civil engineer.
      Her civil engineering projects included working on a hotel near Disneyland
      (It is awesome!) and anchoring air conditioners to hospital roofs
      (They are awesome too!). As a civil engineer she had a stamp with her
      name on it, but as a web developer you can find her name by using git
      blame. Hayley is an avid contributor to her company's #cute-animals
      slack channel. The best part of her job includes helping to onboard new,
      internally trained devs. She is a member of a two developer household,
      which you should consider before accepting her dinner party invitation.
      Hayley's 2018 stretch goal is to acquire a golden retriever--name
      suggestions are welcome."

      fit on the head of a pin."
